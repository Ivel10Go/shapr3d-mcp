# Shapr3D MCP Server

An MCP server that lets AI assistants (Claude, etc.) model real CAD parts and
work with [Shapr3D](https://www.shapr3d.com/).

## How it works

Shapr3D has **no public API or scripting interface** (it's a
[long-standing community request](https://discourse.shapr3d.com/t/mcp-api/37502)).
So this server takes the only robust route:

1. **Real CAD kernel inside the server.** Models are built programmatically
   with [build123d](https://build123d.readthedocs.io/) on the OpenCascade
   B-rep kernel — the same class of geometry Shapr3D uses (Parasolid-like
   solids, not meshes).
2. **STEP file exchange.** Generated models export as STEP, which Shapr3D
   imports as fully **editable solid bodies**. Files you export *from*
   Shapr3D (STEP/IGES/STL) can be inspected, modified, and converted.
3. **App bridge (macOS & Windows).** Tools to launch Shapr3D, open files in
   it, check its state, and screenshot its window for visual feedback — on
   whichever of the two platforms Shapr3D's native app runs.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `create_model` | Build a model from a build123d script (optionally fed by a shared `params_file`), export STEP/STL/3MF/glTF/GLB/BREP |
| `modify_model` | Import an existing file (e.g. Shapr3D STEP export), edit it in code, re-export |
| `detect_clash` | Pairwise interference check between solids (assembly/keep-out verification) |
| `inspect_model` | Solids, bounding box, volume, face/edge counts of a STEP/IGES/STL/BREP/3MF file |
| `convert_model` | Read STEP / IGES / STL / BREP / 3MF, write STEP / STL / 3MF / glTF / GLB / BREP |
| `render_preview` | Shaded isometric PNG preview without opening any app |
| `list_models` | List files in the models workspace |
| `open_in_shapr3d` | Open a file in Shapr3D (STEP imports as editable bodies) |
| `activate_shapr3d` / `shapr3d_status` | Launch / check the app |
| `screenshot_shapr3d` | Capture the Shapr3D window |
| `build123d_guide` | Modeling syntax cheat sheet for the AI |

## Setup

Requires macOS or Windows, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), and Shapr3D
installed (the modeling tools also run fine on Linux/without Shapr3D — only
`open_in_shapr3d` / `shapr3d_status` / `activate_shapr3d` /
`screenshot_shapr3d` need one of the two platforms Shapr3D ships a native
app for).

```sh
uv sync
```

On Windows, run this from a terminal (PowerShell or cmd) with
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed the same way; no other setup is
needed — `pywin32` (used for the app-bridge window lookups) is pulled in
automatically as part of `uv sync`.

### Claude Code

A project-scoped [.mcp.json](.mcp.json) is included — opening this folder in
Claude Code picks it up automatically. To register it globally:

```sh
claude mcp add shapr3d -s user -- uv run --directory "<path-to-this-folder>" shapr3d-mcp
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
(macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shapr3d": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--directory", "<path-to-this-folder>", "shapr3d-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Typical workflow

1. Ask the AI to model something ("design a wall bracket for a 2-inch pipe,
   4 mounting holes for M5 bolts").
2. It writes a build123d script via `create_model`, checks it with
   `render_preview`, and opens the STEP in Shapr3D via `open_in_shapr3d`.
3. You confirm the Import Preferences dialog in Shapr3D (Quality is fine;
   STEP carries mm units) and edit freely — the bodies are native,
   editable solids.
4. To AI-edit an existing design: export STEP from Shapr3D, then ask the AI
   to `inspect_model` / `modify_model` it.

Generated files live in `models/` (override with `SHAPR3D_MCP_WORKDIR`).

## Development

```sh
uv run pytest
```

The suite exercises the modeling tools directly (no MCP transport, no
Shapr3D app needed) in a throwaway workspace.

## Limitations

- `.shapr` files are a proprietary, undocumented format — they can't be read
  or written directly. STEP is the interchange format.
- Parametric history doesn't survive the round-trip (a STEP file is the
  final solid, not the feature tree). Shapr3D's direct-modeling tools work
  on imported solids regardless.
- In-app actions (sketching, export) happen via the user or OS-level
  computer-use automation; there is no app API to drive.
- Shapr3D has no Linux app, so the app-bridge tools raise on Linux; the
  modeling/inspection/conversion tools are unaffected and work anywhere.
- On Windows, locating and focusing the Shapr3D window is best-effort
  (install-path search plus window-title matching) since there is no
  equivalent of macOS's `osascript`/Accessibility APIs.
